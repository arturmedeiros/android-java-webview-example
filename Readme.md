## ‚úÖ Requirements

To use the project, you need to have some packages and starter packages on your computer:

- GIT
- Android Studio
- Java SDK's

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation
Clone this repository and import into **Android Studio**:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:arturmedeiros/android-java-webview-example.git
```

## üì£ Push Notifications `OneSignal`

In the midst of the code, we prepared the necessary fields so that you can integrate the OneSignal service into your Android application! That way, your app will receive the notifications you send through that vendor's dashboard.

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING:** You need to have a OneSignal account and a token to be able to integrate.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configure OneSignal

The code responsible for the integration with OneSignal are commented. You will need to uncomment them and add your Token.
